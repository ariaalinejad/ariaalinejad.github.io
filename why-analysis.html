    <h1>Why Analysis?</h1>
    <p>To an extent it is a game, an exercise in creativity, and expression. Zizek is very good at this, e.g. In the video where he comments on the parallel between tulips 
        and vaginas. In this he also understands the close connection between comedy and analysis.</p>

    <p> other existence of analysis is in using as a means to an end. As a tool to convey a certain idea or philosophy. In this the analyzer uses the object of analyzing 
        as a sign, signifying the though. Making the mental idea less abstract and more graspable. In a way this is as making a new language, where the words are the aspects 
        of the object to be analyzed, which are universal to the speaker and the listener, these form a finite subset that can then be used to express an idea which lies more 
        in the subtext og the message spoken in this language.</p>
        
    <p> analysis can be seen as the exercise of trying to understand the underlying meaning intended by the producer of the content. Personally I believe this to be the most 
        boring of the three. In the first case, e.g. with tulips it is clear that this is not the case. But the second form of analysis can often be misunderstood as an attempt 
        at the third, which takes away from its effect.</p>
