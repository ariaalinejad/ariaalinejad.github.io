        <h1>Why Analysis?</h1>
        
        <p>To an extent analysis is a game, an exercise in creativity and expression. Zizek is very good at this, e.g. In the video where he comments on the parallel between tulips 
            and vaginas [1]. In this he also underlines the close connection between comedy and analysis.</p>
            
        <p> The second aspect of analysis is in using it as a means to an end. As a tool to convey a certain idea or philosophy. In this the analyzer uses the object of analysis 
            as a sign, signifying the though. Making the mental idea less abstract and more graspable. In a way this is as making a new language, where the words are the aspects 
            of the object to be analyzed, which are universal to the speaker and the listener. These form a finite set that can then be used to express an idea which lies 
            in the subtext of the words spoken in this language.</p>
                
        <p> Thirdly analysis can be seen as the exercise of trying to understand the underlying meaning intended by the producer of the content. Personally I believe this to be the most 
            boring of the three. When the first form of analysis is exercised, e.g. with the tulips, it is clear that it is not an atempt at the third form. However, when the second 
            form of analysis is exercied it can often be mistaken for an atempt at the third from of analysis, weakening its effect. </p>
