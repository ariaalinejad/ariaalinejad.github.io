        <h1>Someone Else's Mess</h1>
        
        <p>Written after moving into an apartment in Milan, full of other people's. Most of it belonging to people that had moved out. People I had never seen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The feeling of something being messy or untidy, is connected to the feeling of foreignness. The thing with tidy places is that they are transparent, no lies. 
            So cleaning up is all about organizing things in a transparent way, making the environment predictable. The problem with an untidy rooms is that you can see 
            the objects, but not all of their information. The objects, and the room, has secrets. It is what makes a folded bed sheet better than a crunched up one. It 
            lets you see the whole, you can predict and understand it, it is in your control. One of the worst things that can happen to a person in his/her life is 
            unexpectedly touching wet gum. Expecting dry table but being deceived. Or expecting a certain texture or taste when eating something, but then getting 
            something completely different. </p>
                
        <p>Someone else's mess is always worse than one's own. At least you know the secrets that lie behind your own mess. The mess of a friend would be better than the 
            mess of people I have never seen and will never see. A foreigner's mess is worse than a local's. </p> 
    
        <p>Having a lot of foreigners in one's country is like someone coming to your home and making it dirty. Your home is constantly becoming more and more messy and 
            dirty from someone else's doing. We don't know the secrets, we don't understand their mess, their personality and way of living. They are hiding something 
            from us. The foreigner is worse the further away the country is and the more different their looks are. And Japanese foreigners are much better than Pakistani. 
            We know some of the Japanese culture from moves, food, ect. but the Pakistanis have a lot of secrets. And their religion has too. A totally assimilated foreigner 
            is therefore better, he/she makes you less nervous. But we shouldn't be germaphobes, in constant need of full control. </p>
